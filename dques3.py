# Question 3
# price_milk = raw_input("1L milk ka price daalo?")
# print ("10L milk " + price_milk*10 + " rupees ka aata hai.")
# Save the correct code in a new file and submit it.
#correct code:
price_milk = int(input("1L milk ka price daalo?"))
print ("10L milk " + str(price_milk*10) + " rupees ka aata hai.")
#if you are concatenating with string you have to convert number/2 in string else you can use comma if you dont want to typecaast
